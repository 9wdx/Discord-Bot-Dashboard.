The Discord Bot Dashboard is a powerful web application that allows server owners and administrators to manage their Discord bot through a user-friendly interface. With secure Discord bot token login, users can select their servers, manage bot settings, configure moderation tools, auto-roles, welcome messages, custom commands, and view live analytics. Built with Node.js, Express, Discord.js, MongoDB, and a modern React or Next.js frontend, the dashboard is fully responsive, fast, and easy to use.
